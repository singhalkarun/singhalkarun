<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Karun Agarwal</h1>

I am a technology enthusiast with a passion for solving complex problems through innovative solutions. 

My fascination with technology started young, spending countless hours playing computer games and eventually hosting my first website from home. This curiosity led me to explore how the internet works and fueled my desire to learn more about technology.

Influenced by mentors who encouraged me to seek real-world experience over formal education, I opted for self-directed learning through Coursera. This decision allowed me to gain valuable insights into technology without the constraints of a traditional college environment.

Currently serving as the DevOps Lead at Samagra Governance, I focus on standardizing processes across the organization while developing solutions that optimize deployments and enhance operational efficiency.

If you share a passion for technology and its potential to transform industries, letâ€™s connect! I'm open to networking opportunities and discussions around innovative solutions in tech.
